I'm Wout from Belgium.

I come from a strong background in Computer Science Engineering and my key strengths as a developer lie in my attention to detail, strong problem-solving abilities, and a passion for creating clean and efficient code. I am particularly interested in Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing, where I continuously strive to expand my knowledge and stay updated with the latest developments in the field.

Throughout my programming journey, I have achieved several notable milestones. One of my proudest achievements was starting a company named [BluePrint](https://www.blueprint-edu.be/). This experience helped me grow not only as a coder but also as a team player and a problem solver.
